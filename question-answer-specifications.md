# Question Answer Backend Rest API Specifications

In this project, I created a backend Rest Api that includes basic functionalities that a simple Q&A website provides. This Api can be consumed by any frontend technologies such as React, Angular etc. All of the functionalities of this Backend Api are listed below.


### Questions
- List all bootcamps in the database
   * Pagination
   * Select specific fields in result
   * Limit number of results
   * Filter by fields


- Search bootcamps by radius from zipcode
  * Use a geocoder to get exact location and coords from a single address field
- Get single bootcamp
- Create new bootcamp
  * Authenticated users only
  * Must have the role "publisher" or "admin"
  * Only one bootcamp per publisher (admins can create more)
  * Field validation via Mongoose
- Upload a photo for bootcamp
  * Owner only
  * Photo will be uploaded to local filesystem
- Update bootcamps
  * Owner only
  * Validation on update
- Delete Bootcamp
  * Owner only
- Calculate the average cost of all courses for a bootcamp
- Calculate the average rating from the reviews for a bootcamp

### Courses
- List all courses for bootcamp
- List all courses in general
  * Pagination, filtering, etc
- Get single course
- Create new course
  * Authenticated users only
  * Must have the role "publisher" or "admin"
  * Only the owner or an admin can create a course for a bootcamp
  * Publishers can create multiple courses
- Update course
  * Owner only
- Delete course
  * Owner only
  
### Reviews
- List all reviews for a bootcamp
- List all reviews in general
  * Pagination, filtering, etc
- Get a single review
- Create a review
  * Authenticated users only
  * Must have the role "user" or "admin" (no publishers)
- Update review
  * Owner only
- Delete review
  * Owner only

### Users & Authentication
- Authentication will be ton using JWT/cookies
  * JWT and cookie should expire in 30 days
- User registration
  * Register as a "user" or "publisher"
  * Once registered, a token will be sent along with a cookie (token = xxx)
  * Passwords must be hashed
- User login
  * User can login with email and password
  * Plain text password will compare with stored hashed password
  * Once logged in, a token will be sent along with a cookie (token = xxx)
- User logout
  * Cookie will be sent to set token = none
- Get user
  * Route to get the currently logged in user (via token)
- Password reset (lost password)
  * User can request to reset password
  * A hashed token will be emailed to the users registered email address
  * A put request can be made to the generated url to reset password
  * The token will expire after 10 minutes
- Update user info
  * Authenticated user only
  * Separate route to update password
- User CRUD
  * Admin only
- Users can only be made admin by updating the database field manually

## Security
- Encrypt passwords and reset tokens
- Prevent NoSQL injections
- Add headers for security (helmet)
- Prevent cross site scripting - XSS
- Add a rate limit for requests of 100 requests per 10 minutes
- Protect against http param polution
- Use cors to make API public (for now)

## Documentation
- Use Postman to create documentation
- Use docgen to create HTML files from Postman
- Add html files as the / route for the api

## Deployment (Digital Ocean)
- Push to Github
- Create a droplet - https://m.do.co/c/5424d440c63a
- Clone repo on to server
- Use PM2 process manager
- Enable firewall (ufw) and open needed ports
- Create an NGINX reverse proxy for port 80
- Connect a domain name
- Install an SSL using Let's Encrypt

## Code Related Suggestions
- NPM scripts for dev and production env
- Config file for important constants
- Use controller methods with documented descriptions/routes
- Error handling middleware
- Authentication middleware for protecting routes and setting user roles
- Validation using Mongoose and no external libraries
- Use async/await (create middleware to clean up controller methods)
- Create a database seeder to import and destroy data
